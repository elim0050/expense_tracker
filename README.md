#### Design Rationale
I created a small program to address a common issue among friends—splitting expenses when hanging out. Typically, tracking who paid what and how much others owe is inconvenient and often leads to confusion. The problem was especially troublesome when people forgot to record payments or didn't know how much they owed.

Step-by-Step Process:
1.	Identifying the Issue:

    Managing group expenses manually is tedious and error-prone, especially when people pay for others or forget their share.
2.	Designing the Solution:

    I designed a system that:
    - Able to add participants.
    - Tracks participants and their balances.
    - Records expenses and calculates fair shares.
    - Allows for easy payment recording and updates balances.
3.	Why This Approach?
    - Ease of Use: The program is simple and intuitive, perfect for non-technical users.
    - Automation: It automates the calculations, reducing mistakes and saving time.
    - Flexibility: The program adapts to different ways of handling payments, ensuring everyone’s balance is accurately updated.

In conclusion, this solution simplifies splitting expenses, allowing friends to focus on enjoying their time together without worrying about money.
